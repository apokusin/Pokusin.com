Hey! Welcome to the readme for my personal site!

Here are some interesting things about it:
- My avatar photo updates through Gravatar automatically, as if by magic.
- I added a secret console to tweak parameters of the site, which I use to test experiments/variations. (currently disabled)
- The site has a fade-in animation. It has a JS layer that waits for the page to finish loading all resources before fading in. No JS? The animation runs with a 300ms delay by default.
