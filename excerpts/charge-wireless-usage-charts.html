  <p>Most customers will log in to their management dashboard to either fix a problem or check their recent usage. In order for a customer to see a meaningful amount of data, I opted for two designs. One design for large displays and one for mobile devices.</p>
  <p>Both versions are extremely similar, but the mobile version is slightly simplified. Instead of showing <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> axis labels, I show a simpler version of the chart. However, a customer will likely be looking at this chart trying to identify usage patterns or spikes. The mobile version of the chart makes sure to allow for this by identifying high-usage and low-usage days. This way a customer still have a rough idea of when their usage spiked, and how severely.</p>
