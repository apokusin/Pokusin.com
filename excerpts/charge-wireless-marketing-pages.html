  <p>Charge has a pretty sweet referral program. I worked to design and market the referral program through multiple channels.</p>
  <p>First, I designed and developed a mini-landing page which our marketing campaigns would link back to.</p>
  <figure class="excerpt-figure">

  <p>I made sure to include the proper social media tags so that our posts would look nice in places like Twitter and Facebook (although generic meta tags are included as well).</p>

    <a href="//twitter.com/charge" target="_blank">

  <p>
    I also included a version of the banner on our <a href="//charge.co">primary landing page</a>.

    The final mention of referrals is in a prominent banner at the top of the Charge dashboard. This banner includes a referral code and buttons to share it.
